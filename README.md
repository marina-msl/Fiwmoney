# Fiwmoney

- The application has been developed with React, CSS, Java Script e HTML in frontend and the backend is Java with its libraries and famoust framework, SpringBoot.
- The application purpose is to expand my portifolio and also build an useful tool for myself. I am a super fan of investiments and I realized the need of having a application which could let me know when the stocks are cheapers then my average price (It's time to go shopping!).
- Once this application is to just enrich my knowlege, feel free to make any sugestions, since the clean code and SOLID principles, tecnologies as possible and nice to use, or anything else!

### Next steps - some ideas, or not:
- Handle with 500 error
- What's gonna happening when it search the same code more then once ?
- Frotend?
- Checking the current price , how many times in a day? Or when?
- Spring security and authentication?
- BD no Docker?
