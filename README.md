# Fiwmoney

- The application has been developed with Vue.js, CSS, Java Script and HTML in frontend and the backend is Java with its libraries and famoust framework, SpringBoot.
- The application purpose is to expand my portifolio and also build an useful tool for myself. I'm a big fan of investiments and I realized the need of having a application which could let me know when the stocks are cheapers then my average price (It's time to go shopping!).
- Once this application is to just enrich my knowlege, feel free to make any sugestions, since the clean code and SOLID principles, tecnologies or anything else!

### Next steps - some ideas, or not:
- Spring security and authentication? with login ? How to make the relationship between stocks and user?
- Deploy with docker or AWS?
- Unity tests?
- change to Mongo DB?  
  
#### Done:
 
- [X] Frotend? Change to Vue Framework?
- [X] BD no Docker?
- [X] Change to PostgreSQL
- [X] Microservices - the search-api is gonna be separete from fiwmoney ? (Now, yes, let's see the next steps)
