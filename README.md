# Fiwmoney

- The application has been developed with React, CSS e HTML in frontend and the backend is Java with its libraries and famoust framework, SpringBoot in the backend.
- The application purpose is to expand my portifolio and also build an useful tool for myself. I am a super fan of investiments and I realized the need of having a application which could let me know when the stocks are cheapers then my average price (It's time to go shopping!).
- Once this application is to just enrich my knowlege, feel free to make any sugestions, since the clean code and SOLID principles, tecnologies as possible and nice to use, or anything else!
